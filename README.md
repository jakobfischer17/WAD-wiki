# WAD-wiki
This was my first university project and first somewhat completed coding project in general. It is a wiki website that can be hosted locally following the instructions below.
The work was done in collaboration with https://github.com/Odogwudozilla and was our first website project. it is written in Ruby using Sinatra.
This project was initially hosted on BitBucket, since GitHub did not offer private repos until recently.
